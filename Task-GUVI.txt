1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in JavaScript

--------------------------------------------------------------------------	

1st Answer: 

HTTP/1.1
* It works on the textual format.
* There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn't get its all resources.
* It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
* loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

HTTP/2
* It works on the binary protocol.
* It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
* It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
* It is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.


2nd Answer:

Objects, in JavaScript, is its most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript's primitive data-types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don't actually store the value.
